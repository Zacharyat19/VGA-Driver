# ECE-271-Design-Project
A collection of SystemVerilog code, ModelSim results, and block diagrams used for the ECE 271 design project.

This project uses an adruino remote to send a signal to a VGA driver, moving a sprite on a VGA monitor. The driver was made in Quartus Prime and programmed on the DE10-Lite board.
